## ðŸŒŸ Introduction
This project aims to provide implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch. It is intended for educational purposes and to serve as a starting point for more complex projects.

## ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression
Linear regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line through the data points that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the line.

### ðŸ“Š Generating the Training Set
The training set for the linear regression model is generated using the `generate_training_set.py` script. This script creates a dataset with a specified slope, intercept, number of data points, and noise level.

### ðŸ§  Training the Model
The linear regression model is trained using the `LR_1Feature.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. This notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Reading the Training Set**: The training set is read from a CSV file.
2. **Model Function**: Calculates the output from the current model with the parameters `w` (slope) and `b` (intercept).
3. **Cost Function**: Computes the cost (mean squared error) of the model, which measures how well the model's predictions match the actual data.
4. **Compute Gradient**: Computes the gradient `dj_dw` and `dj_db`, which are the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to `w` and `b`. These gradients indicate the direction and rate of change of the cost function.
5. **Gradient Descent**: Optimizes the model parameters using gradient descent. This iterative algorithm updates `w` and `b` to minimize the cost function by moving in the direction of the negative gradient.
